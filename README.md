# Swaye SDK

This is a TypeScript-based project that provides a Client for interacting with blockchains through Swaye. The SDK includes various API endpoints for interacting with blocks, transactions, and users on the blockchain.

## Getting Started

To get started with the sdk, install it using a package manager.

```
npm install @swaye/swaye-sdk
```

Then, instantiate the client:

```
import SwayeClient from '@swaye/swaye-sdk'

const BASE_URL = ''

//Bearer token received through oauth
const BEARER_TOKEN = ''

const client = new SwayeClient(BASE_URL, BEARER_TOKEN)
```
